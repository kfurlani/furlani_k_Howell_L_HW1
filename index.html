<h1>Krystal and Liam's Fantasy Super Smash Bros Team</h1>


<p>Krystal and Liam will both be sharing what top 3 characters they <br> would choose to be on their Fantasy Super Smash Bros Team!
<h2>Meet Krystal</h2>

<p>
From a young age Krystal had to learn what it takes to be good at Super Smash Bros. <br>
With two older brothers, the competition was always stiff.<br>
When choosing a fighter, the choice always needed to be strategic…pick the seemingly <br>
innocent characters so your opponent doesn’t suspect you know how to play.<br>
Which is why below are Krystal’s top 3 picks for her Fantasy Super Smash Bros Team. 
</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Kirby - As innocent looking as it gets. Kirby’s main strength is annoying your opponent, with the <br>
ability to inhale other characters and take on their special abilities, Kirby is a great choice if you want <br> to bother others. </li>
<li>Ness - For a small child Ness’ power is surprisingly fatal. Almost all of his moves can send your opponents to <br> the blast line with serious force. Not many people are willing to take the risk on Ness, which makes him <br>
a great unexpected choice. </li>
<li>Yoshi - if Kirby is annoying than Yoshi is infuriating. Yoshi has a similar ability to Kirby that he can <br>inhale other characters, except he can’t take on any of their abilities. With his egg shield and fast air <br>    speed  Yoshi can get out of almost anything. This little green dinosaur is sure to secure you a win. </li> 

</ol>

 <h2>Meet Liam</h2>

<p>
Liam was a very big gamer growing up so when it came to Super Smash Bros he picked it up easily enough. <br>
Liam had two younger brothers who were also pretty good gamers and you could argue they were more competative and picked up on the skills quicker. <br>
This never stopped Liam from doing the best he could with the knowledge and skills he had. <br>
To be fair though, most picks were just because they were some of Liam's favourite characters growing up. <br>
The character choices were not so innocent and would be picked to be a little more agressive. <br>
Below are the choices that Liam would pick for his Smash Bros team
<p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Bowser - Public enemy of Mario since the early 1980s Bowser is not a foce to be messed with. <br>
Although he is one of the larger characters and has more targetable surface area he makes up for it with his heavy hits. <br>
His final smash in Smash Bros Ultimate can be a real game ender if you know what you're doing and can use it effectively. </li>
<li>Link - Link is just a bit of a favourite for me, I have played Zelda from such a young age nad it is my favourite game series by far. <br>
I kind of can't help but picking him. He is pretty agile in the battlefield making him useful for getting around. <br>
His final smash is a little less intimidating and a lot easier to dodge but powerful if you hit it right. <br>
Can you really blame me though, Link is a pretty cool character regardless of his stats, he saves Hyrule all the time, good enough for me. </li>
<li>Steve - Minecraft was a very popular game growing up and still is. People always made jokes of Steve making it into Smash. <br>
I don't think anyone really expected it but it was a cool addition nonetheless. <br>
The way he plays is very different from others but thats what makes him cool. He still has his block building, crafting and many other cool things. <br>
Regardless of whether he was a joke or not to begin with, its cool to have him in the Smash Bros family. <br>
It is also kind of funny to see Kirby take on a form of him and just become a pink square. </li>
