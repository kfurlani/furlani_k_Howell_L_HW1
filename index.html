<p>
From a young age Krystal had to learn what it takes to be good at Super Smash Bros. <br>
With two older brothers, the competition was always stiff.<br>
When choosing a fighter, the choice always needed to be strategic…pick the seemingly <br>
innocent characters so your opponent doesn’t suspect you know how to play.<br>
Which is why below are Krystal’s top 3 picks for her Fantasy Super Smash Bros Team. 
</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Kirby - As innocent looking as it gets. Kirby’s main strength is annoying your opponent, with the <br>
ability to inhale other characters and take on their special abilities, Kirby is a great choice if you want <br> to bother others. </li>
<li>Ness - For a small child Ness’ power is surprisingly fatal. Almost all of his moves can send your opponents to <br> the blast line with serious force. Not many people are willing to take the risk on Ness, which makes him <br>
a great unexpected choice. </li>
<li>Yoshi - if Kirby is annoying than Yoshi is infuriating. Yoshi has a similar ability to Kirby that he can <br>inhale other characters, except he can’t take on any of their abilities. With his egg shield and fast air <br>    speed  Yoshi can get out of almost anything. This little green dinosaur is sure to secure you a win. </li> 

</ol>
